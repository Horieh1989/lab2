    "**Purpose**\n",
    "The purpose of this lab is to use the tools you’ve learned in Python to implement a simplified machine learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you are given (simulated) data on the lengths and widths of Pichus and Pikachus. You will create an algorithm that, based on the given data, can determine whether a new data point should be classified as a Pichu or a Pikachu.\n",

    "### Basic Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow this flowchart to build the basic algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given test points:\n",
    "\n",
    "* (25, 32), (24.2, 31.5), (22, 34), (20.5, 34)\n",

    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Allow the user to input a test point, and let the algorithm determine its class.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Include error handling for negative numbers and non-numeric inputs.\n",
    "   * Make sure error messages are user-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The approach we used with just the **nearest point** may give incorrect classifications when the classes overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Instead, select the **10 nearest points** to your test point.\n",
    "   * The class of the test point is then decided by a **majority vote** among those nearest points.\n",

    "   * 50 samples are test data (25 Pikachu, 25 Pichu)\n",

    "2. Calculate accuracy using the formula:\n",

    "   *Here we define Pikachu as the “positive” class and Pichu as “not-Pikachu” (negative).*\n",
    "\n",
    "   > Note: For each test point, calculate the distance to the training points.\n",
