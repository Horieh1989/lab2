# Lab 2 – Classifying Pokémon with Nearest Neighbor

## Description

This Python program implements a simplified machine learning algorithm to classify Pokémon as either Pichu or Pikachu based on their width and height. The program uses the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to make predictions.

## Features

* Reads Pokémon data (width, height, and type) from a file.
* Lets the user input a new Pokémon’s dimensions.
* Classifies the new Pokémon based on the nearest 15 neighbors in the dataset.
* Displays a scatter plot of existing Pokémon and the new Pokémon.
* Handles invalid input (negative numbers, non-numerical values).

## How to Use

1. Run the `main.py` script.
2. Enter the width and height of a Pokémon when prompted.
3. The program will predict whether it is a Pichu or a Pikachu.
4. A scatter plot will appear showing existing Pokémon and the new Pokémon.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
